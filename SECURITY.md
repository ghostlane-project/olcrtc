# Security policy

olcRTC carries other people's traffic and hides the shape of it. A flaw here can
expose exactly what someone went out of their way to protect, so security
reports are treated as the most important work in the queue.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue.**

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
<https://github.com/romanpodpriatov/olcrtc/security/advisories/new>

It is private between you and the maintainers, takes attachments, and becomes a
published advisory crediting you once a fix ships. If you cannot use it, open an
issue with no technical detail asking for another channel.

## What to include

The version or commit, the transport and provider involved, what an attacker
must be able to do first, what they get, and the smallest reproduction you have.
A proof of concept is welcome and never required.

## What to expect

- An acknowledgement within three days.
- An assessment within two weeks: whether we agree, how serious we think it is,
  and what we intend to do.
- A fix in a release, and an advisory crediting you unless you prefer otherwise.

There is no bounty programme today.

## Scope

In scope: this engine, its transports and its handshake, the keys and metering
it manages, and anything it ships in a release.

Out of scope, though worth telling us about anyway: the meeting services the
engine speaks to (Jitsi deployments, Yandex Telemost, WB Stream), the operators
of relays you connect through, and the applications that embed this engine other
than [Ghostlane](https://github.com/romanpodpriatov/ghostlane).

## Disclosure

We ask for time to fix before publication, and we do not ask for silence. Ninety
days is the default; longer if we say why, sooner if the fix is out sooner. A
flaw already being exploited changes the timetable, not the courtesy.

## What this software does not promise

It disguises a tunnel as a media session. It does not make its user anonymous,
it cannot help against an adversary who controls the device, and the meeting
service can always see that a call took place and how much it carried. Those are
properties of the design and are documented; a report showing one of them is
weaker in practice than documented is very welcome.
