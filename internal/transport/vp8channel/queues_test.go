// of ~1.4 KB each, 8 MB of headroom in a process allowed about 50. Measured
// with the phone's runtime profile against a Telemost room, an Ookla-shaped
// load took the client from 45 MB to 61 MB of RSS, and the extension that
// carries it dies at about 48. The constrained profile now sizes them to one
// KCP window.
