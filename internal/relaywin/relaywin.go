// Package relaywin bounds what a sender has handed a relay for one
// destination and the destination has not yet taken off it: an end-to-end
// window per destination, over a relay that never pushes back.
//
// An SFU that relays data between participants reads a sender's channel as
// fast as frames arrive and queues them toward each receiver. LiveKit 1.5.3,
// which SaluteJazz runs, acknowledges a megabyte at once and queues toward a
// subscriber without a limit; the JVB queues about 2 MB and drops the rest
// (olcrtc#15). Either way the sender's own channel says nothing about the
// receiver's leg, and on a slow one the queue grows to whatever smux's
// windows allow: megabytes, tens of seconds of it, with the tunnel's control
// pings waiting at the back (olcrtc#49).
//
// So a sender counts the bytes it hands the relay for each destination and
// follows them, every MarkEvery bytes, with a mark that carries the count.
// The destination echoes a mark when its receive path reaches it. The relay
// delivers in order, so an echo means every byte before the mark has left
// the relay; what is in flight is what was sent less the last count echoed,
// and a sender holds while that is a whole Window. The count is the sender's
// own, so a frame lost anyway cannot skew it: the next echo covers it.
//
// The carrier owns the wire - how a mark and an echo are framed, and whose
// echo counts for which destination. This package counts and decides:
//
//   - A window holds a sender only once it is on: an echo came from the
//     destination (ApplyEcho), or the destination said some other way that it
//     speaks the window (Arm). An older build never echoes and is sent to as
//     before. Until it echoes, a destination is marked at least once a
//     ProbeAfter, so one that does speak the window turns it on within an
//     interval of traffic.
//   - An echo moves a window only past its last echo and within what was
//     sent. Counts never start over: a window opened after a Reset starts at
//     the count of every byte counted here, past every mark sent before it,
//     so a late echo of one of those is out of its range.
//   - A sender held for ProbeAfter since the last mark marks again (Room asks
//     for it), which repairs a lost mark or echo. One held for DeadAfter
//     without an echo lets the destination go: its window is off, and what
//     waits for it goes as it would without one. Liveness, not the window,
//     decides that a peer is gone.
//   - Each window has an epoch, which Reset, ResetAll and Bump replace. A
//     sender that parked under one epoch and wakes under another holds a
//     frame for a session that is over, and must not send it.
//   - A frame the carrier would rather drop than hold, a datagram, asks Over
//     instead of Room: it goes until the window is on and more than a Window
//     and the carrier's slack is in flight, or a sender has been held on the
//     window for ProbeAfter. The slack lets datagrams through beside a bulk
//     sender that keeps the window full, which is let go at every echo; the
//     yield keeps a datagram flow as fast as the destination's leg from
//     taking every byte an echo frees before a held sender looks again, which
//     would hold it until liveness closed the session. Over only looks, so
//     asking it on every datagram moves none of the clocks a held sender runs
//     on.
//
// A sender that has to wait takes its window's Wake before it asks Room, then
// waits on that channel and a Retry timer. An echo that moves the window, a
// Reset or a Bump of it, and ResetAll close the channel, so a wake between
// the question and the wait is not missed. One wake releases every sender
// parked on that window and none parked on another: a server with a sender
// parked per client wakes the one an echo made room for, not all of them on
// every echo from any of them.
//
// A carrier that sets Timing.TargetQueue has each window sized for its leg
// instead of held at Window: a fixed window is seconds of queue on a slow leg,
// and a pong waits behind all of it. The window times each echo against the
// mark it answers and, once a second while a sender is held on it, measures
// the rate its destination takes bytes off the relay. It starts at
// firstSizedWindow, and its size is then
//
//	rate × (shortest echo round trip + TargetQueue)
//
// no less than MinWindow and no more than Window: what the leg carries in a
// round trip, and TargetQueue of queue on top. A sender that is never held
// sends less than the leg takes, and its rate says nothing about the leg, so
// the size stays. The shortest round trip only goes down, until a Reset; on a
// leg whose queue never empties it still holds the first mark's own interval,
// so the queue settles somewhat above TargetQueue, never above what that one
// interval adds. Marks follow the size, so a small window still has several
// echoes in flight to time. Nothing on the wire changes: the size is the
// sender's own, so a peer on any build is sent to as before.
//
// Jitsi keeps its own copy of the mechanism, where it was proved
// (internal/engine/jitsi/relaywindow.go); this is that mechanism without a
// wire, for the carriers that came after it.
//
// ai-generated: the whole package (olcrtc#49).
