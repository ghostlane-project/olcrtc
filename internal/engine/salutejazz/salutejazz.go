// Package salutejazz implements an engine.Session over the SaluteJazz
// connector, the signaling endpoint of the Sber video service. The connector
// is LiveKit wrapped in a JSON envelope: the client sends
// {roomId, payload, event, groupId, requestId} and the payload of a media
// frame carries a LiveKit signal method (rtc:config, rtc:offer, rtc:ice,
// rtc:ping) instead of protobuf.
//
// The service needs no account. What a guest must know is a room code and
// its password, which the auth package turns into the connector URL
// (engine.Config.URL) and the password (engine.Config.Token).
//
// Two peer connections are required. The SFU offers a subscriber PC and
// creates the _reliable and _lossy channels on it, but data written to those
// channels is dropped without an error: only the channels of a publisher PC
// the client itself offers are relayed to the room. This engine therefore
// answers the SFU's offer, then offers a publisher PC carrying both
// channels, and sends on the publisher while it receives on the subscriber.
