// ai-generated: the whole file (the relay window's budget, olcrtc#49).

// The relay window's size answers to numbers that were chosen in other places
// for other reasons: the tunnel's pong timeout, the lane's high-water mark,
// the gate's connect budget and its SaluteJazz throughput floors. Each test
// below writes one of those relations down and reads those numbers where they
// live, so a change on either side that breaks it fails here rather than on a
// slow Sber leg. They are tests of the external package because the gate
// reaches this engine through the client, so this package cannot import it.
//
// Two kinds of input are not read where they live. The record is
// SlowLegRecord, this package's copy of the datachannel transport's largest
// payload (defaultMaxPayloadSize, which that package does not export): a
// change there has to be carried here by hand. The leg rates and round trips
// are measurements, written down with where each comes from.

// budgetProvider is the name the gate judges a SaluteJazz pair under. A name
// the gate does not know gets the target's own floors, which the window does
// not carry twice of, so a stale name fails the floor test rather than passing
// it.

// to a window on the way back, and the slowest SFU-to-receiver leg a failing

// with 0.8 s for the connect's own round trips and the server's dial, that
