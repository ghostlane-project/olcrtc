// The relay window (olcrtc#49). LiveKit 1.5.3 acknowledges what a sender
// writes at once and queues it toward each receiver without a limit, so on a
// slow SFU-to-receiver leg the queue grows to whatever the receiver's smux
// windows allow - megabytes, tens of seconds of it - with the tunnel's
// control pings waiting at the back until liveness closes a session whose
// bytes are still arriving. The lane's own high-water mark cannot see it: it
// measures the first hop, which the SFU never lets fill.
//
// So every send on the reliable lane counts against a window toward its
// destination (internal/relaywin): a sender may have handed the SFU at most
// relayWindow bytes for one destination that the destination has not echoed,
// and waits while it has. Which destination a send counts against:
//
//   - a payload addressed to one participant, that participant: the server's
//     reply to a client, keyed by the identity the SFU stamps on the client's
//     packets;
//   - a payload to the room, on a client, the server its ConfirmPeer bound;
//   - anything else, nothing. A room-wide send before the handshake has
//     confirmed a server is the hello, and small.
//
// Datagrams count too: the SFU queues them in the same FIFO. They are never
// held - a datagram late is a datagram lost - so one is dropped instead once
// more than a window and datagramSlack are in flight to its destination and
// the window is on, and also while a reliable send to it has been held for a
// probe interval: a datagram flow as fast as the leg would otherwise take the
// room every echo frees, and the byte stream behind it - control pings too -
// would wait until liveness closed the session. A client's datagrams go to
// its confirmed server alone, so none of them is queued toward anyone else in
// the room.
//
// The window is on only once the destination has shown it speaks it: its
// first window frame arms it (a client's ConfirmPeer sends one, a mark of
// count 0, ahead of any data, so a server is armed before its first reply
// byte), and so does an echo. A peer of a build before the window never sends
// either, and is sent to as it always was. A server marks nobody who has not
// spoken the window first, so an older client is never handed a frame it
// cannot read; a client marks the server it confirmed from the start, and an
// older server drops the unknown topic as a frame it cannot decrypt.
//
// On the wire a mark or an echo is a UserPacket under windowTopic on the
// reliable lane, addressed to the one participant it is for:
//
//	[version=1][kind: 1 mark, 2 echo][counter, u64 big-endian][advertised window, u32 big-endian]
//
// The counter is the sender's count of bytes handed to the relay for that
// destination when the mark went out, and an echo carries back the counter of
// the mark it answers. The advertised window is reserved for budgeting a
// receiver that several senders fill at once: version 1 writes the window it
// keeps, and a version 1 reader takes the frame whatever it says.
//
