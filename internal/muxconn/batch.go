// ai-generated: the whole file (write batching for olcrtc#11).

// batcher gathers the small smux frames written close together into one
// record, so that a burst of them reaches the relay as a few messages rather
// than hundreds. A link asks for it with transport.Features.WriteInterval.
//
// The Jitsi bridge queues at most 50 messages per sender and drops the
// oldest when its forwarding falls behind. A burst of new streams is a SYN,
// a CONNECT, window updates, an ack and FINs per stream on the two sides;
// sent one frame per message, it overflowed that queue and lost the acks of
// dozens of streams at once. smux reads records as one byte stream, so a
// record that carries several whole frames needs nothing new from the peer.
//
// A frame never waits when the last record left an interval ago. A batch
// that reaches half a record leaves at once, and the Write that made it so
// returns only once it has gone to the link, as every Write did before: bulk
// data is not held here in front of the link's own queue, and a stream
// behind it keeps its place in smux's round robin. Only small frames that
// follow each other closely share a record, which then leaves one interval
// after the last.
